Code required for making executable file.

1- import sys, os, time

First you have to add these libraries.

2- Paste this code just below the libraries.

if _name_ == "__main__":
    if getattr(sys, 'frozen', False):
        chromedriver_path = os.path.join(sys._MEIPASS, "chromedriver.exe")
        driver = webdriver.Chrome(chromedriver_path)
    else:
        driver = webdriver.Chrome()

3- Open the command prompt in the folder where your python file (that you have to make executable) is present.

4- Paste this pyinstaller command in the CMD.

pyinstaller -F --add-binary "Chrome driver path here";"." filename.py

pyinstaller --add-binary "Chrome driver path here";"." filename.py

for single executable file paste as is and for other files with executable remove '-F' from command.

python -m pip install pip==19.0.3
